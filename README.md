#### Description

Baseeks is a really basic theme for WordPress. That simply means **it won't display any stuff** on your screen, but it is a base for all themes you want to build yourself with **your own templates**.

I'm actually testing it on various production websites, and **it is not ready** !

#### Instructions

You will find everything it theme files, if you have any questions contact me !

#### Blueprints

* Create a child theme to simplify theme updates
* Create an auto update theme script
